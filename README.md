# NOTES

The app was developed with a conspicuous lack of real TDD or tests besides smoke tests.  

The app is currently unstyled in order to focus on feature development.

Cleverer schemes for caching and API interaction can be envisioned but are not strictly within scope.

# TODO
- User registration (Devise)
- Companies in address book
- People in address book (Contact)
- Association of contacts to companies (CompanyContact)
- Pagination on company search (Find API query params)
- Styling (drop in Bootstrap or UIKit)
- Rate limiting wrt API interaction
